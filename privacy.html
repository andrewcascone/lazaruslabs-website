<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated: January 2026</strong></p>

<p>
Lazarus Labs (“we”, “our”, “us”) is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy.
This privacy policy explains how our mobile applications handle information.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
Our applications do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information.
There is <strong>no account creation, login, or user profile</strong> within our apps.
</p>

<p>
However, our applications may use third-party services that automatically collect certain types
of data for advertising, analytics, crash reporting, or performance measurement.
This data is collected by the third party—not by Lazarus Labs.
</p>

<h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
Our apps may integrate with the following third-party services:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – used for displaying ads. AdMob may collect:
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers (e.g., IDFA/AAID)</li>
      <li>Approximate location (based on IP address)</li>
      <li>App interaction data (e.g., ad views, clicks)</li>
      <li>Crash and performance data</li>
    </ul>
    This data is processed in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy:

    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
  </li>
  <br />

  <li><strong>Apple App Store Services</strong> – may collect analytics and crash logs on iOS devices.</li>
</ul>

These third-party services may use collected data to personalize advertising, measure ad performance,
or for fraud prevention. Lazarus Labs does not receive or store this data.
</p>

<h2>3. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
<p>
Our apps do not use cookies. Third-party services such as Google AdMob may use tracking technologies to deliver
and measure advertisements.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
Since we do not collect or store personal data, we retain <strong>no user information</strong>.
Any retention of diagnostic or advertising data is managed solely by the third-party services listed above.
</p>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>
We take privacy seriously and design our apps so that <strong>no personal data is handled directly by us</strong>.
Security for any data collected by third-party services is governed by their respective privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>6. Your Consent</h2>
<p>
By using our apps, you consent to the processing of data by the third-party services integrated into the application,
as described in this policy.
